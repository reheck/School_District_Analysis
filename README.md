# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of Project
### The school board is interested in the district's high schools performance in math, reading, and overall. Aside from district performance, the school board is interested in how each of the high schools compared to each other and the district as a whole regarding these scores. Furthermore, the board is interested to see how the budget per school compares with student success. Finally, the school board is interested specifically in Thomas High School and how removing 9th grade scores affects the per high school scores and the district overall scores analysis. Utilizing pandas in python, district and school summaries were created and analyzed for the school board's needs.
